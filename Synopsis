Proof of work:

Available domain combining Proof of work (POW) with portfolio: Powport.com

Colleges are dying: 
We are coming to understand that a degree is something you pay for; Universities are not required for an individual to learn material/ become an expert in anything.

We can prove our qualifications with a large-spanning portfolio.

A site that is a collection of everything you want to showcase to the world in terms of demonstration of credibility & viability as an applicant.

This will not replace the ecosystem of linkedin, but will be a great addition to it.
We intend to be THE bio link used on linkedin.

HEATMAP:

There is value in Virality: i think there is a business model in young kids simply creating traction via virality: if you can prove intention and timeline/ process of creating a viral trending tag this has value which should be able to be put in a portfolio. Or a site where you can simply index the most viral trends and see heatmaps of the most trendy stuff going on. Itâ€™s a creator dashboard called heatmap. 

Essentially what we could do is connect viral creators with brands attempting virality, and kids with a proven track record of virality are more sought after for their advice then 30 year old MBA 5+ years in the industry experience 300k student debt marketing majors


THis is a way for agencies to decrease ad budget by connecting directly with creators.

I believe the credit is not effectively being placed with the creators of trends. Sure the celebrities that hop on them are known for them, as well as the creator of the song that likewise goes viral, but there is something to the social engineering of it, the ability to do this consistently also helps prove credibility with demonstration of track record.
